Description: The concept of KNN,SVM and K-means. 

KNN Algorithm:
      First,we assume that point A belongs to Category F1 and we have one thousand points in dataset. Then we start to calculate Euclid's 
      distance between every point and point A. After calculation, we get 1000 numbers which represent distance from each point to point A.
      Next, we sort them by ascending order(which is from smallest number to the largest number).After sorting, we will pick first point 
      to the kth point(k is determined by programmer).When we pick k points, we can get frequency each category appear(assume each point
      has been assigned to a category).Then we can find a category which appears most in these k points and treat these k points as this
      category.
      
SVM Algorithm:
      SVM is a big topic which contains linear model and non-linear model. the main idea of SVM is to create a space divider u which u 
      can be represented by u=wx+b(w is
