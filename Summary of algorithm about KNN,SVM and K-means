Description: The concept of KNN,SVM and K-means. 

KNN Algorithm:
      First,we assume that point A belongs to Category F1 and we have one thousand points in dataset. Then we start to calculate Euclid's 
      distance between every point and point A. After calculation, we get 1000 numbers which represent distance from each point to point A.
      Next, we sort them by ascending order(which is from smallest number to the largest number).After sorting, we will pick first point 
      to the kth point(k is determined by programmer).When we pick k points, we can get frequency each category appear(assume each point
      has been assigned to a category).Then we can find a category which appears most in these k points and treat these k points as this
      category.
      
SVM Algorithm:
      SVM is a big topic which contains linear model and non-linear model. the main idea of SVM is to create a space divider u which u 
      can be represented by u=wx+b(w is 
       

K-Means Algorithm:
      To operate K-Means Algorithm, we need to pick k points as centroid. then we calculate Euclid's distance from remaining points to
      each centroid.After that, we assign these points to cluster which has shortest distance from them(each centroid represent center
      of each cluster).Then, calculate avearge value of all points in each cluster. set the average value as new centroid of cluster,
      and continue to do same things above until no point change to another cluster.
